                Dermatoglyphics refers to the branch of science in the study of the patterns of skins (dermal) ridges present on the fingers, toes, and the soles of humans. It reveals the congenital links between our fingers and our intrinsic qualities and talents. These patterns are formed from the external ectoderm and usually occur during the fetal development stage, The human's fingerprints form is thus formed from the 13th to 21st week.
                Medical experts and scientists thus discovered that the amount of brain cells distributed in different parts of the brain helps us understand a person's multiple intelligences as well as his innate potential capabilities and personality through DMIT Test.
                DMIT (Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test) is a biometric analysis based on the scientific study of fingerprints. DMIT is useful for all age groups, it is particularly beneficial for parents and teachers to understand a child's innate strengths as well as areas that need molding. Armed with this information that is obtained purely from the child's biometric, DMIT assessments give crisp actionable insights.
